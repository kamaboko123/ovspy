## Getting Started

### Configure Open vSwitch Manager
This library manipulate Open vSwitch by access OVSDB  
You need to configure OVSDB manager port to manipulate OVSDB from ovspy via TCP.
```
sudo ovs-vsctl set-manager ptcp:5678
```

### Bridge
```
import ovspy.client

ovs = ovspy.client.OvsClient(5678)

#Get exist all bridges
#This function return list of OvsBridge instance
for br in ovs.get_bridges():
    print(br.get_name())

#Find bridge by bridge name
#This function return OvsBridge instance
#If specified bridge is not found, the function return None
bridge = ovs.find_bridge("br0")
print(bridge.get_name())


#Add bridge
#If specified bridge is already exist, This function raise ovspy.ovs_error.Duplicate
ovs.add_bridge("br1")

#Delete bridge
#If specified bridge is not exist, This function raise ovspy.ovs_error.NotFound
ovs.del_bridge("br1")
```

### Port
```
import ovspy.client

ovs = ovspy.client.OvsClient(5678)

#Get Bridge instance
bridge = ovs.find_bridge("br0")

#Get all ports which is associate to birgde
for p in bridge.get_ports():
    print("%s:(%s)" % (p.get_name(), p.get_vlan_info()))

#Find port by name
port =  bridge.find_port("p0")
print(port.get_name())

#Add port(Access port)
bridge.add_port("p1", 10)

#Add port(Trunk port)
bridge.add_port("p2")
bridge.add_port("p3", [])

#Add port(Trunk port with restrict vlan)
bridge.add_port("p4", [10, 20])

#Delete port
bridge.del_port("p3")

```
